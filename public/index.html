        <h1><i class="fa fa-terminal fa-3x"></i></h1><br>
        <p>I'm a second year CS major at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. My areas of interest include computational linguistics, data science, web programming, and pretty much anything I could do as a job because I really could use the money. I really like Python as far as languages go. C is pretty alright too. C++ is nice sometimes but others I kinda feel like it's trying too hard, y'know?</p>
        <h1><i class="fa fa-comment-o fa-3x"></i></h1><br>
        <p>In my spare time, I love reading comics (especially Daredevil and Captain/Ms. Marvel) and watching TV (Parks and Rec, anyone?). I'm also a Beater on the Illini Ridgebacks Quidditch Team, which is probably about as hardcore of a sport as you're thinking it is. I play games sometimes, but I'm absolutely terrible at pretty much everything except Pokemon.</p>
        <h1><i class="fa fa-envelope-o fa-3x"></i></h1><br>
        <p>I don't really know what to put in this column. I know I could use 2 columns and still be alright, but I mean it just didn't look too great. So I figured we could take a quick minute here, catch up with each other. How are you doing? I'm alright, had a bit of a busy week, but every week is pretty packed, honestly. It's pretty nice talking to you, we should do this more often. I'm at ncwells2@illinois.edu if you wanted to shoot me an email sometime.</p>

      <p>So I know all you guys wanted to see a modal element and a video element so I figured why not get two birds with one stone here and make a modal video.</p>
      <p>The following feature has been approved for all ages.</p>
      <p>It's a video of my dog playing in really deep snow. She was not harmed in the filming of this featurette.</p>
      <p>Click the paw to launch the video!</p>
